# Scheduling Tasks

This is a Spring Boot application designed to schedule and execute tasks periodically. The application demonstrates how to use the Spring Frameworkâ€™s `@Scheduled` annotation to create scheduled tasks that run automatically at regular intervals.

## Features

- **Periodic Task Execution**: The application prints the current time to the console every 5 seconds.
- **Simple Scheduling with `@Scheduled`**: Task scheduling is configured in a simple and efficient way using Spring annotations.
- **Automated Tests for Scheduled Tasks**: Tests are included to ensure the scheduled tasks run correctly.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**: The latest stable version for development.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework for building Java applications quickly and efficiently.
- **JUnit 5**: For writing and running tests.
- **Mockito**: For mocking dependencies and interactions in tests.
- **Awaitility**: For verifying asynchronous operations in tests.
- **SLF4J**: For simple and effective logging.
